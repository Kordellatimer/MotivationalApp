# Motivation App!
An App that will give you a motivational quote depending on the time of the day. There are Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Late night quotes that you can receive, with some soothing music in the background to help with the overall experience.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JQuery), API

First I created a container that has a description of what the app does, a timestamp for when you visited the app, and a button with a span tag where I append the quote I receive from the API. Once you click on the "Generate Quote" button it will receive the json and output the quote. The background changes depending on the time and you experience nice soothing music to get you in the perfect mood to focus!

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to apply Object Oriented Programming (OOP) better to my project and how cleaner and easier to find issues in my code.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
